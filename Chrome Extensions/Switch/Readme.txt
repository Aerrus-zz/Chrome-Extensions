Switch

With the click of a single button, the user can open or close websites he/she has set.

This extension hopes to help people save time when "Switching" tasks.

Examples:
People want to take a break from studying. A single click can open facebook, youtube, and any video game sites. Another click closes them.
A video game streamer wants to start streaming. A single click opens up twitch, azubu, and youtube to stream across these platforms immediately.
When starting on homework, click to open Wikipedia (#reliable), Wolfram Alpha (we understand), and any music site.
